            </a>
            <h2>Recipie Title</h2>
            <p>Heat the oil in a medium pan over a medium heat. Fry the onion and garlic for 8-10 mins until soft. Add
                the chorizo and fry for 5 mins more. Tip in the tomatoes and sugar, and season. Bring to a simmer, then
                add the gnocchi and cook for 8 mins, stirring often, until soft. Heat the grill to high.

                STEP 2
                Stir Â¾ of the mozzarella and most of the basil through the gnocchi. Divide the mixture between six
                ovenproof ramekins, or put in one baking dish. Top with the remaining mozzarella, then grill for 3 mins,
                or until the cheese is melted and golden. Season, scatter over the remaining basil and serve with green
                salad.

                <h1 class="ABBU">GRILLED CHICKEN WITH FRESH CHERRY SALSA</h1>
            </a>
            <h2>Recipie Title</h2>
            <p>- Place the chicken breasts in a large ziplock bag and pound them using a heavy pan or rolling pin to
                uniform thickness.
                - Mix together the oil, salt, pepper and chipotle pepper powder and rub the mix into the chicken breasts
                well.
                - Allow the chicken to marinate for a bit while you prepare the cherry salsa.
                - Roughly chop pitted cherries and put them in bowl.
                - Add finely diced shallot (or red onion), chopped jalapeno and chopped fresh cilantro.
                - Add salt, pepper, balsamic vinegar and squeeze in fresh lime juice.
                - Mix well and allow all the flavors to meld by letting it sit out till you grill the chicken or cover
                and refrigerate for later.
                - Heat a grill pan over a medium-high heat or fire up the BBQ.
                - Grill the chicken breasts over a medium-high heat for 4-6 mins a side, or until cooked through. Let
                the cooked chicken rest for 5 mins.
                - Slice and place chicken on a plate (on a bed of salad leaves if you'd like) and spoon the fresh cherry
                salsa generously on top.

            </a>
            <h2>Recipie Title</h2>
            <p>Put all the eggs, honey, bananas, oats, baking soda and salt (if using) in a blender. Put them in the
                order listed, so the liquid ingredients are on the bottom for easier blending.
                Put the lid on the blender and turn it on. Let the ingredients mix until well combined. If it seems like
                things are stuck and not moving turn the blender off, take the jar off and shake it. Then put it back on
                and continue to blend it.
                Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray. I used a 5 x 9 inch loaf pan which was the perfect size for the
                amount of batter I had. Pour the batter from the blender into the prepared loaf pan.
